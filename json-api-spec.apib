# Group Products

## Create a product [POST /products/new]

## Edit a product [POST /products/{product_id}]

# Group Photos

## Upload a photo [POST /photos/new]

## Remove a photo [DELETE /photos/{photo_id}]

## Fetch a photo [GET /photos/{path_segment_1}/{path_segment_2}/{geometry_or_style}/{original_filename}]
Given a geometry (or predefined style), this will either serve a pre-generated photo, or, will resize and crop on-the-fly and serve the freshly generated image.
  
  + Parameter
    + path_segment_1 (string) - generated when the photo is uploaded. Is generally sent as part of a photo URL provided by some other JSON endpoint (eg. product details endpoint)
    + path_segment_2 (string) - generated when the photo is uploaded. Is generally sent as part of a photo URL provided by some other JSON endpoint (eg. product details endpoint)
    + geometry_or_style (string) - Needs to be one of the whitelisted set of photo geometries (or styles). Allowing any geometry will open up a DOS attack vector.
    + original_filename (string) - generated when the photo is uploaded. Is generally sent as part of a photo URL provided by some other JSON endpoint (eg. product details endpoint)
  + Response 200 (image/png)
    + Body
      (whatever the web server needs to do to send the image)
